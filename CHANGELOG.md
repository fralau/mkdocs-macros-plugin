* Added the multiline parameter `force_render_paths` in the config file,
  to specify directories or file patterns to be rendered for the case when `render_by_default = false`
  (the `render_macros` parameter in the YAML header of the page
  has the last word).

## 1.0.5, 2023-10-31

* Added: git.short_tag (#183)
* Added: Mermaid diagrams in the documentation (Readthedocs)
* Fixed: Changelog was no longer displayed (#186)

* Fixed: Warning due to filter issue with mkdocs >= 1.5
* Fixed: Debug html tables (including for `macro_info()`) are 
    now readable also in dark mode.

## 1.0.2, 2023-07-02
* Added: it is now possible to use macros in page titles, in the
    nav section of the yaml file, or in the level 1 titles; 
    the macros are correctly interpreted in the navigation part
    of the page.

## 1.0.1, 2023-05-25

## 1.0.0-alpha, 2023-04-23

* Improved user guide, with introduction of two new pages:
    "Controlling macro rendering" and "Post production".

* Fixed: (#158) In modules, `on_pre_page_macros()`, the `env.markdown` 
    attribute is now available to create a header or footer.

* Changed: In `on_post_page_macros()` use `env.markdown` instead of
    `env.raw_markdown`, for the same purpose.

* Added: (#162) Allow opt-in of page rendering, by using parameter
    `render_macros: true` in yaml header of the page
    (requires `render_by_default:false` in the macro parameters,
    in the config file).

* Fixed: `macro_info()` now generates a header of category 2,
    so as to be used with other material in the same page,
    and not confuse the macro generators.

* Changed: `ignore_macros: true` in page header is deprecated. 
    Use `render_macros: false` instead.

* Fixed: issues #155 (documentation type), #143 (`git.tab`), 
    #135 (indicate page where rendering failed).

* Bump version to 1.1.0 to acknowledge that API is stable.

         macro directory (package)

         are no longer replaced by blanks but displayed as is (DebugUndefined) (#117);
         for better compatibility with other plugins or error detection
* Added: `on_undefined` parameter in plugin definition to alter behavior 
         with unknown jinja2 variables: 'keep' (default), 'silent', 'strict', 'lax';
         documentation was updated

Warning: Breaking Change

* Fixed: impossibility to use imported Jinja2 macros, without `with context`
    clause (#81). Now macros are imported as global.
* **Removed: Do not define macros as variables any longer, but as macros.**
    - incorrect: `env.variables['foo'] = foo` (though it should still work)
    - correct: prefix declaration with `@env.macros` 
      or `env.macros['foo'] = foo`
* Added: Changelog is also part of documentation
* Added: Documentation moved under Material them, slate variant (dark)
* Added: Amended documentation (test install, discussions)

## 0.5.9, 2021-04-22

* Added: Changelog (Fixed #82)


## 0.5.8, 2021-04-21

* Fixed: display better message in case of macro syntax error 
    (line_no, message, incriminated line in file).
    Traceback was useless with that specific exception, and has been removed.

## 0.5.7, 2021-04-21

* Added: Possibility (for large projects) to exclude a markdown page 
    from macro rendering, with `ignore_macros: true` in YAML header
    (fixed issue #78, and answered discussion #79)

## 0.5.6, 2021-04-19

* Added: Files object to the mkdocs-macros environment (fixed #80)
* Fixed: Documentation errors or omissions
* Fixed: Do not install pluglet mkdocs-macros-test by default (#50)
    In order to do testing, 
    type: `pip install 'mkdocs-macros-plugin[test]'`

## 0.5.5, 2021-03-03

* Starting point
